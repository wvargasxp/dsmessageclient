Reporting Bugs
==============

This code was extracted from the Android Open Source Project as released by Google and its
partners.

I will not merge pull requests which involve substantial changes to the code base, which must stay
as close to AOSP as possible. Bug reports and patches
[should be sent upstream](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/entry?template=Developer%20bug%20report).

Feel free to send bug reports and pull requests for packaging problems or minor patches to improve
compatibility with your device (ideally, these should be less than 5 lines and not too intrusive).
