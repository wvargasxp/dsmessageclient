{"Name":"Android Support Library v7 GridLayout","Id":824,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv7gridlayout","Description":"The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running old android flavors.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users.\n\n*Portions of this page are modifications based on [work][3] created and [shared by the Android Open Source Project][1] and used according to terms described in the [Creative Commons 2.5 Attribution License][2].*\n\n[1]: http://code.google.com/policies.html\n[2]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/\n[3]: http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html\n","Version":"20.0.0","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"v7 Support GridLayout Library\n=========================\n\nThere are several libraries designed to be used with Android 2.1 (API level 7) and higher. \nThese libraries provide specific feature sets and can be included in your application independently \nfrom each other.  \n\nThis library adds support for the [GridLayout][4] class, which allows you to arrange user interface elements \nusing a grid of rectangular cells.
